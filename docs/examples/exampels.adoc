Tricked <tricked@tricked.dev>

Here is a example module that just sends a notification when clicked, it uses the build in notify module to achieve this.
[source,lua]
----
include::send_notify.lua[]
----

You can also run keybinds using the `event_sender` module

[source,lua]
----
include::switch_scene.lua[]
----
You can bind keybinds scenes to keybinds so in this example i bound the first scene to `ctrl+alt+shift+l`` and the other to `P`, once the button is clicked it'll check what the last one was and do the other one making the scenes switch.

You can bind scenes in obs in the keybind menu and searching scene.
