Linkpad is a tool to create a gui for a bunch of "macros" you have defined / or from the presets .

It can be used to:

* Change scenes in obs
* Pause stream
* Run keybinds
* Close currently open application
* Take screenshots
* Send notifications
* Run API requests
* Open specific applications

All can be done via lua but we provide a bunch of templates that you can use if you dont want to program anything, you can use this application perfectly fine without knowing lua!
